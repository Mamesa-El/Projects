# Lab 1 Documentation
### What the Application Does 
The application in question refers to the 'main.py' file. It provides a FastAPI service using uvicorn with multiple endpoints. The custom-made endpoint is /hello, which returns a 'Hello, {name}' message based on the name parameter provided. Additionally, three other endpoints are autogenerated. The root endpoint '/' returns a 404 status code indicating 'Not Found'. The '/docs' endpoint showcases the corresponding OpenAPI documentation (status code 200 for OK), while the '/openapi.json' endpoint returns a JSON object conforming to the OpenAPI specification (status code 200).

### How to build the application
The application is constructed based on commands and information provided within the Dockerfile. This Dockerfile guides the creation of a Docker image using the command: 'docker build -t my-api ./lab1'.

### How to run the application
The application, encapsulated in a Docker container, can be initiated with the command: 'docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name apiContainer my-api'. This command constructs a container from the Docker image detailed earlier, positioning it within a desired environment.

### How to test the application
For testing purposes, a test_src.py file has been created, which functions as unit tests utilizing FastAPI's TestClient. This file comprises unit tests for the '/hello', '/', '/docs', and '/openapi.json' endpoints, accounting for potential edge cases.

# Lab 1 Questions:
1. What status code should be raised when a query parameter does not match our expectations?<br/>
    In these scenarios, FastAPI generates a '422 Unprocessable Entity' status code or detail message. For instance, FastAPI would typically return this status when the '/hello' endpoint is accessed with 'mamesa=name' as an input parameter. 
2. What does Python Poetry handle for us?<br/>
    Poetry is a pivotal tool for Python dependency management. It facilitates the building of projects under specific Python versions and dependencies within isolated environments. Each project possesses a .toml file that contains dependency details, making it apt for distribution. With Poetry, dependencies can be effortlessly added, updated, or locked within the .toml file.
3. What advantages do multi-stage docker builds give us?<br/>
    Multi-stage Docker builds primarily aid in minimizing the resultant image size. By segregating the build process and transferring only essential artifacts to the ultimate image, we achieve reduced image sizes. This not only ensures swifter deployments but also minimizes resource consumption, and potential security risk.
