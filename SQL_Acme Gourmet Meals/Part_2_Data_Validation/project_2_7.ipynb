    "As stated in the scenario, like most companies, AGM does not want to give out its customer list to 3rd party sales channels.  The downside is, as we have seen, that customer first names, last names, and street addresses will have some variations and not be exact matches.\n",

This is a large percentage, and if AGM is to scale out its operation, even more, the total amount of mismatching customers with increase relative to that. However, verifying and cleaning up the mismatched customers' names were relatively easy and fast.\n",
